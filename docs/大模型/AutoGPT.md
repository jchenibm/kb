# AutoGPT

https://www.github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT

Auto-GPT is an "AI agent" that, given a **goal** in natural language, will attempt to achieve it by breaking it into sub-tasks and using the internet and other tools in an automatic loop. It uses OpenAI's GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 APIs, and is among the first examples of an application using GPT-4 to perform autonomous tasks.
